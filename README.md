# Quantitative-Valuation-Portfolio-Optimization
Quantitative Valuation Portfolio Optimization Project
Introduction
The "Quantitative Valuation Portfolio Optimization Project" is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at optimizing investment portfolios through advanced quantitative valuation techniques.

Implementation Details
Data Collection: Acquired relevant financial data from various sources, including stock market indices, individual stock prices, and economic indicators.

Valuation Models: Utilized diverse valuation models, such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Price-to-Earnings (P/E), and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratios, to determine intrinsic values of securities.

Risk Assessment: Employed statistical methods and historical data to assess and quantify risk factors associated with different investment options.

Optimization Algorithms: Implemented cutting-edge portfolio optimization algorithms, including Mean-Variance Optimization and Capital Market Line, to construct well-balanced portfolios with optimized risk-return trade-offs.

Literature Review
Conducted an extensive literature review on modern portfolio theory, asset pricing models, and optimization techniques to ensure a robust and informed approach.
